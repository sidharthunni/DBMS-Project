# TripNest - Tourism and Trip Planner

A full-stack DBMS mini project. Users can explore destinations, hotels and packages, plan trips, book and pay for packages (simulated), save destinations, write hotel reviews, and cancel bookings with refund records. Admins get a dashboard with users, trips, bookings, payments, emails, refunds and messages.

## Features
- Customer and Admin login tabs with role-based access (session tokens, bcrypt password hashing)
- Plan a trip in 6 steps, saved in the database, viewable in **My Trips**
- Package booking with an automatic total price (database trigger)
- Simulated payment: a successful payment confirms the booking (trigger) and logs a confirmation email
- Booking cancellation with a refund policy, run as a transaction in a stored procedure
- Wishlist (many-to-many), hotel reviews, search and filters using indexed queries
- Destinations, packages and hotels (photos, rooms, amenities, policies, FAQs) loaded from MySQL
- Admin dashboard: users, trips, bookings (status update), messages, payments, emails, refunds

## Tech stack
HTML, CSS, JavaScript | Node.js, Express | MySQL 8 | mysql2, bcryptjs, cors, dotenv

## Database highlights
24 tables, 3 triggers, 2 stored procedures, 1 view, check constraints, a generated column, and indexes.

backend/                      Express server and API routes

```

## Setup
1. Install [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org) and MySQL 8.
2. Run the SQL scripts in `database/` **in this order** (MySQL Workbench: open file, run all):
   `01_schema.sql`, `02_upgrade_roles_payments.sql`, `03_upgrade_destination_columns.sql`, `04_upgrade_hotel_details.sql`, `05_upgrade_refunds.sql`
   (`01_schema.sql` drops and recreates the `tripnest` database.)
3. In the `backend` folder, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your MySQL password and an admin invite code.
4. Install and start:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   node server.js
   ```
5. Open http://localhost:3000

## First admin account
Open the Register page, choose the **Admin** tab, and register with your `ADMIN_CODE` from `.env`. Everyone else registers as a customer.

## Notes
- Payments, refunds and confirmation emails are **simulated**: no real money moves and no real email is sent. They are stored in the `payments`, `refunds` and `email_log` tables.
- Open the site through `http://localhost:3000` (not by double-clicking the HTML files) so the API calls work.
- Photos are online image links, so an internet connection is needed to see pictures.
